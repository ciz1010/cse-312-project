PART 3 LO3, CREATIVITY AND DOCUMENTATION
Our unique feature is that our website possesses an upvote and downvote feature that allows authenticated users to express their interests or disinterests towards message uploads they see in the chat. Each user is only allowed to either upvote or downvote, once either option is selected, there is no way to retract this. A good way to test this would be to open two seperate browsers, logging in to each one and upload amessage on each. After doing this, on one browser upvote its respective image, and on the other, downvote. After doing this, try to select the same option again to see if the upvote/downvote count changes within that respective browser. This should not work. Also, in the browser you selected upvote, select downvote instead and do the opposite on the other browser. Nothing else should increment because you are only allowed one upvote or downvote per message.After ensuring this works, you can then, select one browser and selecting the message uploaded by the user from your second browser, you can select to upvote/downvote the message. You should find that if the user already upvoted/downvoted that image, the upvote/downvote button will be incremented by 1 which will then make it 2. And if you select an upvote/downvote option that wasn't previously selected by the user from the other browser, you will find the upvote and downvote counters both at the value of 1.
